# ⌨️ ZMK Config

I've been using a wireless [Ferris Sweep][sweep] from
[Boardsource][boardsource] with [Ambients switches][ambients] since Spring
2024. I love it!

This repository holds its firmware configuration. I had initially
[tweaked][tweaked] the thoughtful [Miryoku][miryoku] layout and used that quite
happily. Now I am inlining it all here so it'll be easier for me to tinker
with.

I have primarily removed some Miryoku features I wasn't using and
experimentally added the [Sturdy][sturdy] keyboard layout as an alternate
layer, to see what I think of it. Future work may include a QWERTY alternate
layer so I can let friends test-drive the keyboard more easily, as well as
exploration of non-momentary layer changes, since my thumbs get a little
fatigued holding layer switches down.
